Rules for test scripts
======================
1. Run tests. Don't just print things.
2. Don't use print. Use diag if you have to write something. If you use O2::Script::Test::Common,
   diag only prints if the "verbose" (or "v") commmand line option is set.
3. Clean up after yourself.
  - The database and file system should be in the same state before and after the test has executed.
  - Write clean-up code in an END method, so the code will run even if the script dies.

To run all tests:
perl runTests.pl
perl runTests.pl --harness
